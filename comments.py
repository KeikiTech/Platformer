# Welcome to comments.py. This program is full of comments. 

# It hardly does anything at all.

# In Python, comments start with the "#" character. When the computer is reading your program,
# if it sees a "#" it ignores everything that comes after it -- until the next line.

# I can put anything I want in comments, and it doesn't change the way the program runs.
# Look -- I can even draw a cat picture:

#      /\_/\
#     ( o o )
#     ==_Y_==
#       `-'


# Try running this program, then adding some comments of your own, then running it again.
# Bonus: can you tell what the output of this program will be without running it?

print("hello")
#print("goodbye")



# If you remove the "#" symbol at the beginning of the next five lines, the output of the 
# program will change. Try it.

#a = 5
#b = 6
#a = b + a
#b = a
#print(b)
